# Caribou Gold
A browser-based 8-bit game set during the Fraser River and Cariboo Gold Rushes (1858â€“1867), inspired by *Stardew Valley*. Built with Phaser 3, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: Phaser 3 game code (maps, mini-games).
- `backend/`: Node.js/Express API for user data and game logic.
- `assets/`: 8-bit sprites, tilesets, and Tiled JSON maps.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Caribou-Gold.git`
2. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
3. Install backend dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
4. Configure database in `backend/config/db.js`.

## Development
- Frontend: Run `npm start` in `frontend/` to launch Phaser 3 in Grok Studio.
- Backend: Run `npm start` in `backend/` to start the API.
- Assets: Use Aseprite for sprites and Tiled for maps.
